# Lead-Acid-Battery-Charger

The Lead Acid Battery Charger Project was a semester-long project (Semester 3) on which our team worked for more than 3 months. For this project, we were implementing a circuit which is able to chage 14V-20V Lead acid battery in 2 stages( Constant current mode and constant voltage mode).

Features
Two-stage charging process for lead-acid batteries (Constant Current and Constant Voltage modes).
Charging voltage range: 14V-20V.
Efficient analog circuit design.
